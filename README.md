# learnopengl
#### Overview
This is a repository that contains experimental and exercise
code during my learning process of OpenGL. These exercises are done
mostly based on tutorial from learnopengl.com. I'm tying to make some of
them more interesting and original as long as I have had enough
knowledge and skills on OpenGL programming.
#### Compile
Currently it works only on Unix-alike systems.
