# learnopengl
#### Overview
This is a repository that contains experimental and exercise
code during my learning process of OpenGL. I'm tying to make some of
them interesting if I have enough graphic knowledge and skills.
#### Compile
Currently the CMakeLists.txt only support Ubuntu system. It is likely
to work on other Linux based systems but not for OS X and Windows.
The CMakeLists.txt file need to be modified, before using it on other
systems. (Especially the part to link external libraries like GLFW,
GLAD and GLM)

To install OpenGL on Ubuntu, simply type:

`$ sudo apt-get install build-essential`

`$ sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev`
